# pdf-img-convert.js
**A pure javascript package to convert a PDF into images**

**This package is powered mainly by Mozilla's [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js)**

## Motivation

There are a lot of solutions for converting PDFs with javascript already but they all make excessive use of the filesystem in the form of
temporary files and use non-native binaries like ghostscript.

This solution solely uses javascript arrays, cleaning up the pipeline significantly and (hopefully) making it faster.

## Installation

```bash
npm install pdf-img-convert
```

## Usage

The package returns an `Array` of `Uint8Array` objects, each of which represents an image encoded in png format.

Here are some examples of its usage - obviously import the module first:

```javascript
var pdf2img = require('pdf-img-convert');
```

The package has 1 function - `convert`. It accepts the following pdf formats as input:

* URL of a PDF (e.g. www.example.com/a.pdf)

* Path to a local pdf file (e.g. ../example.pdf)

* A `Buffer` object containing PDF data

* A `Uint8Array` object containing PDF data

* Base64-encoded PDF data

**NB: it is an asynchronous function so returns a `promise` object.**

The output can be manipulated using the `conversion_config` argument mentioned below.

Here's an example of how to use it in synchronous code:

```javascript
// Both HTTP and local paths are supported
var outputImages1 = pdf2img.convert('http://www.example.com/pdf_online.pdf');
var outputImages2 = pdf2img.convert('../pdf_in_local_filesystem.pdf');

// From here, the images can be used for other stuff or just saved if that's required:

var fs = require('fs');

outputImages1.then(function(outputImages) {
    for (i = 0; i < outputImages.length; i++)
        fs.writeFile("output"+i+".png", outputImages[i], function (error) {
          if (error) { console.error("Error: " + error); }
        });
    });
```

It's a lot easier and cleaner to implement inside an `async function` using `await`:

```javascript

(async function () {
  pdfArray = await pdf2img.convert('http://www.example.com/pdf_online.pdf');
  console.log("saving");
  for (i = 0; i < pdfArray.length; i++){
    fs.writeFile("output"+i+".png", pdfArray[i], function (error) {
      if (error) { console.error("Error: " + error); }
    }); //writeFile
  } // for
})();

```

There is also an optional second `conversion_config` argument which accepts an object like this:

```javascript
{
  width: 100 // Number in px
  height: 100 // Number in px
  page_numbers: [1, 2, 3] // A list of pages to render instead of all of them
  base64: True,
  scale: 2.0, // scaled twice as large
  intent: 'print' // can choose 'display' (default), 'print' (higher DPI of resulting images), or 'any'
}
```

(Any of these attributes can be omitted from the object - they're all optional)

* `width` or `height` control the scale of the output images - One or the other, it ignores height if width is supplied too.

* `page_numbers` controls which pages are rendered - pages are 1-indexed.

* `base64` should be set to `true` if a base64-encoded image output is required. Otherwise it'll just output an array of `Uint8Array`s.

* `scale` is the viewport scale ratio, which defaults to 1 (original width and height).

* `intent` is how you intend to use the resulting images, with 'display' as the default, 'print' giving a higher DPI for more print-worthy graphics, or 'any'
